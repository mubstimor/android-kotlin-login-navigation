# Implementing Login with Navigation on Android with FirebaseUI

This is part of the Advanced Android in Kotlin course. You'll get
the most value out of this course if you work through the codelabs in sequence,
but it is not mandatory. All the course codelabs are listed on the [Advanced Android
in Kotlin codelabs landing page](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-welcome).

This repository is to support the [Android Conditional Navigation with Login codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-login-navigation)
While you can download the starter code for this codelab if you haven't done the previous codelab,
you may find it beneficial to complete the [Implementing Login on Android with FirebaseUI codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-login) first.

## Setup

You will need to register this app with Firebase for it to work, if you havenâ€™t completed the [Implementing Login on Android with FirebaseUI codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-login), follow these steps to [create a firebase project](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-login/#3) and register the app to it.
